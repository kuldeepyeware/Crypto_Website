## Available Scripts

I built this project from YouTube by following a step-by-step tutorial provided by a [https://youtu.be/b50zSyLiCYQ?t=16764](https://youtu.be/b50zSyLiCYQ?t=16764). As a part of the learning from the tutorial, I learned how to use React Hooks, React Router, and API calls.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all dependencies in root folder

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
